Boot Loader Demo 2

An example to demonstrate the use of the boot loader.  After being started by
the boot loader, the application will configure the UART, wait for select
button to be pressed, and then branch back to the boot loader to await the
start of an update.  The UART will always be configured at 115,200 baud and
does not require the use of auto-bauding.

Both the boot loader and the application must be placed into flash.  Once the
boot loader is in flash, it can be used to program the application into flash
as well.  Then, the boot loader can be used to replace the application with
another.

The boot_demo1 application can be used along with this application to easily
demonstrate that the boot loader is actually updating the on-chip flash.
