Hibernate Example

An example to demonstrate the use of the Hibernation module.  The user
can put the microcontroller in hibernation by pressing the select
button.  The microcontroller will then wake on its own after 5 seconds,
or immediately if the user presses the select button again.  The program
keeps a count of the number of times it has entered hibernation.  The
value of the counter is stored in the battery backed memory of the
Hibernation module so that it can be retrieved when the microcontroller
wakes.
