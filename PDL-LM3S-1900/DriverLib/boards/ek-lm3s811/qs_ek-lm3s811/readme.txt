EK-LM3S811 Quickstart Application

A game in which a ship is navigated through an endless tunnel.  The
potentiometer is used to move the ship up and down, and the user push button is
used to fire a missile to destroy obstacles in the tunnel.  Score accumulates
for survival and for destroying obstacles.  The game lasts for only one ship;
the score is displayed on the virtual UART at 115,200, 8-N-1 during game play
and will be displayed on the screen at the end of the game.

Since the OLED display on the evaluation board has burn-in characteristics
similar to a CRT, the application also contains a screen saver.  The screen
saver will only become active if two minutes have passed without the user push
button being pressed while waiting to start the game (that is, it will never
come on during game play).  An implementation of the Game of Life is run with a
field of random data as the seed value.

After two minutes of running the screen saver, the display will be turned off
and the user LED will blink.  Either mode of screen saver (Game of Life or
blank display) will be exited by pressing the user push button.  The button
will then need to be pressed again to start the game.
